# Pokémon 3D sprites

This is a collection of animated gifs for all known Pokémons.

I created this in order to have a more comprehensive collection to use with my app https://github.com/phcs93/prodex

> I've choosen to pick the "outlined" version of the sprites because it looks better with a dark background (which my app uses).

Feel absolutely free to use these or point directly to this repository, I don't think GitHub servers will mind it.

## Name pattern

The files are named according to the following pattern:

`{id}[-f][_s].gif`

For example:

| Pokémon | file name |
| - | - |
| male Venusaur | `3.gif` |
| shiny male Venusaur | `3_s.gif` |
| female Venusaur | `3-f.gif` |
| shiny female Venusaur | `3-f_s.gif` |

> The weird use of underscores and hifens are just so Windows Explorer shows these in a easy to read order.

The files are named using the https://pokeapi.co/ ids, so all alternative forms (region specific, gigantamax, etc) are indexed starting at id 10000 and onwards.
